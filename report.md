# Report

Please follow the below instructions to report a user/s or channel/s that violate Mimic's [policies](https://github.com/nickmimic/mimic-policies). 

## Copyright Infringement

Please follow the instructions at our [terms of use](https://github.com/nickmimic/mimic-policies/blob/master/terms-of-use.md) page.

### Users and Channels Behavior

If users or channels violate our [terms of use](https://github.com/nickmimic/mimic-policies/blob/master/terms-of-use.md) please create documentation (log files, screenshots, recordings, etc.) Do not attempt to fake evidence or you will be banned instead. 

The fastest way to report abuse of our terms of use is to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SFf8ecV) channel. Alternatively you can submit an [email](mailto:social@mimicstream.com). 

As stated in the terms of use, all users must abide by the following code of conduct:

  * Users must be at least 13 years old to register an account.
  * Impersonating other users, including but not limited to website staff, is
    prohibited.
  * Harassing other users is prohibited.
  * Blackmailing, doxxing, or otherwise sharing personal information without
    permission is prohibited.
  * Raiding, trolling, spamming, or otherwise disrupting channels is prohibited.
  * Advertising other channels is allowed only with permission from the
    administrators of both the channel being advertised and the channel where
    the advertisement takes place.  Blatant spamming of links to your channel in
    other channels will result in a permanent ban from the website.
  * Attempting to disrupt the service or circumvent its security is prohibited.
    Please see the [security policy](security.md) for details.
  * All users are required to abide by the rules of the below Channel Content
    policy when sharing content in any channel.
    
We expect channel owners to enforce Mimic terms of use within their own channels. Channel owners who encourage users to break the rules or ignore the rules themselves will be warned or banned. 

**Discretion is entirely up to Mimic team members.**

**All decisions are finale.**

**Bans may be appealed but serious cases will be declined.**

Mimic team will not interfere with channel owner's management decisions. If you feel you were unfairly banned from a channel, you must appeal to the channel owner and not to the Mimic team members.
