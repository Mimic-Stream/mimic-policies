### Discord Support

Live support for Mimic is available on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/SFf8ecV). Discord support is offered on a best-effort 
basis; you may not get an immediate response. If you don't get a response after 
15 minutes, it probably means no one is available.

### Email Support

We also provide support via [email](mailto:social@mimicstream.com).  we aim to respond to
emails within 5 business day.  You can also email [our founder](mailto:nick@mimicstream.com) if
you don't hear back or need urgent help.

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the [community specialist](social@mimicstream.com).

**When submitting a bug report:**

  * If the issue is a critical exploit (e.g., an exploit that allows you to
    crash the service or bypass security measures), please send me an email
    instead of reporting the issue publicly
  * Include a detailed description of the problem
  * If possible, explain how to reproduce the problem
  * Ensure that you've tried the following before submitting the report
    - Clear your cache and cookies and try again
    - Disable all browser extensions and try again
    - Try a different browser

**When submitting a feature request**

  * Search the issue tracker to check if it has been requested previously
  * Include a description of the feature and explain why it is useful
  * When relevant, include a mock up (doesn't have to be fancy, just a simple
    drawing will do)
